Having never created a blog before, I will be slow at first. My plan for this blog is to share a photo every day for the next two-hundred days. Each photo will be inspired by a cliche. And, just saying, I don't plan on being lame since cliches start out lame. My goal is to take mundane sayings and place a personalized and somewhat quirky spin on them. I have decided to start tomorrow so I can figure out the whole blogging thing first. If you are reading this, thank you. I am a student at UTA, technically a senior, but I still have a ways to go.
